## Temporary Solution

For development purposes, you can use placeholder images from the UI design folder or use solid color backgrounds until final images are provided.

To quickly copy from UI design folder:
```bash
# This is just documentation - implement as needed
cp "UI design/splash screen.png" assets/splash-bg.jpg
cp "UI design/onboarding_1.png" assets/onboarding-1.jpg
cp "UI design/onboarding_2.png" assets/onboarding-2.jpg
cp "UI design/onboarding_3.png" assets/onboarding-3.jpg
cp "UI design/Sign up.png" assets/auth-bg.jpg
```
